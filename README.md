We examine how moment-to-moment fluctuations in arousal and attention affect brain and cognition. There are 3 main themes:

The role of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system in human cognition
The effects of phasic and tonic arousal on information processing
Moment-to-moment fluctuations in attention and cognitive control
We investigate these topics using behavioral methods, EEG, fMRI, pharmacology, pupillometry, patients studies and computational modeling.
